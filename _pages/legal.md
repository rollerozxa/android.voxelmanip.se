The Old Android Game Archive contains a collection of pages for old games for the Android platform in the purpose of documenting and preserving the early years of Android as a gaming platform. Most of the games documented can be considered to be [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware), a legally grey state where the copyrights are still active but the game is not actively being distributed by the copyright holder.

Downloads provided for games no longer available through official distribution methods are hosted on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) with the purpose of archival and preservation of Android gaming history. No APKs are directly hosted by this site, and images such as game icons and screenshots are used to visually identify the game that is being documented.

We will never offer free download links to paid games which are still sold.
