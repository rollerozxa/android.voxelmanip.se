*Tesla Plushies* is a simple yet difficult physics-based game centered about creating gravitational pulls with your finger to navigate a set of plushies to the goal. Some plushies have different colours that need to be transported to their respective goals, and there are angry plushies which give a score reduction if they end up in the goal.

The development of the game was quite short-lived and was quite likely an experiment made before or during the development of what would later become [Apparatus](apparatus).
