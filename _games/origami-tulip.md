## Download
The game was fully reliant on a server for it to function, which was shut down in late 2017. As such the game is no longer functional and attempting to install it will simply show an infinite "Contacting server..." blue screen.

However, for archival purposes, a collection of versions of Origami Tulip can be found on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/com.adamschmelzle.origami.tulip.43).
