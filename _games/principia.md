*Principia* is a complex physics-based sandbox building game featuring robotics, circuitry, Lua scripting and more. It was released for Android in addition to later Windows and iOS.

It was the sequel to the game [Apparatus](apparatus), but never saw a lot of success and development was subsequently discontinued in late 2014 after the release of 1.5.1 due to financial difficulties.

The game had since received a small cult following who kept the game alive for many years and eventually the game was released as open source in 2022. The game continues development by the community as an open source project, and is now also free to download.
