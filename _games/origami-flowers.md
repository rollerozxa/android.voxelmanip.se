*Origami Flowers* was a series of mobile games by Adam Schmelzle that would link up together into what could be best described as a flower growing MMO. It was also available on Java ME feature phones and the iPhone, but Android was undoubtedly where it had the largest impact. The games were very popular between 2009-2013, but slowly began fading out after that point.

In late 2017, the servers for Origami Flowers and related games was permanently shut down, making them unplayable.

## Games
This page serves as a common article for the following apps that all existed at some point:

- Origami Rose
- Origami Daisy
- Origami Iris
- Origami Orchid
- Origami Sunflower

After a certain update <sup>[when?]</sup> it was possible to start and select any of the five flowers in the Origami Rose and Origami Daisy apps, while the three other apps were effectively deprecated.

In 2014, a spin-off called [Origami Tulip](origami-tulip) was released, with a slightly different premise compared to the other games.

## Download
The games were fully reliant on a server for it to function, which was shut down in late 2017. As such the game is no longer functional and attempting to install it will simply show an infinite "Contacting server..." blue screen.

However, for archival purposes, a collection of versions of Origami Daisy and Origami Rose are available on the Internet Archive. But they *will not work* unless you have some kind of replacement server to point them to.

## Replacement server
Around 2019 a replacement server was being developed by ROllerozxa, however it was abandoned before much of the game's functionality was reimplemented, and there is no instance of it running. The final source code for it can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rollerozxa/flower-web).
