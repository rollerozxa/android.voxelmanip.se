*Apparatus* is a physics-based sandbox and puzzle game with focus on mechanics. The game contains a set of puzzles where the purpose is to construct things to get a blue ball into the basket.

There is also a sandbox mode which allows you to freely build all sorts of contraptions with the objects that the game provides to you, and you were able to upload it to the community site (shut down in early 2018) where you could also play levels that others have made.

When Apparatus was released in 2011, it received widespread critical acclaim and news coverage from Android news outlets and beyond, topped the list of both best selling and top rated game in Android Market at its peak, and was handpicked as "Editor's Choice" by Google for several months.
