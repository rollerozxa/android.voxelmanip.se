*ShakyTower* is a physics-based game for Android where you tilt your device to control the gravity and move around cute cubes that will make fun faces and sounds.

## Download
The last version of the main version was called "TotalFree" which removes all in-app-purchases and ads making the game effectively free of anti-features. But as a likely unintentional consequence this also made it more difficult to skip levels as level skips from the store are less ubiquitous.

## Soundtrack
The game has a MIDI-based soundtrack with songs taken from elsewhere. As they are played using Android's built-in soundfont, it will make them sound different if you try to play them on a computer with a different soundfont. To get the faithful playback experience you should use the [Android soundfonts](/android-soundfonts) in Fluidsynth or similar.

All of the sound files can be found in the `res/raw/` folder of the APK files. For the regular version, the soundtrack is as following:

- Main menu: music_ringtone_05.mid
- In-game 1: music_bjorn_lynne_lets_go.mid
- In-game 2: music_bjorn_lynne_retro_electro.mid

The Christmas special has a different set of MIDI music, which are the following:

- Main menu: music_electrica_rumba.mid
- In-game 1: music_12th_warrior.mid
- In-game 2: music_beneath_another_sky.mid
