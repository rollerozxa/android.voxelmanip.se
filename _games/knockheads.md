*Knockheads* is a game where you fling a yellow grinning smiley at other smilies in order to cause chain reactions, and the objective is to hit all smileys in a level. There is a leisure mode which allows you to complete each level with as many tries as possible, as well as a panic mode where you go through levels completed in the leisure mode with one attempt for each level.
